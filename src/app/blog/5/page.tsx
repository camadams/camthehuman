            BnbNotifiter, an app I created to notify you of new Airbnb listings, is live. <br />
            You can view it <Anch link="https://bnbnotifier.com" text="here" addSpaceAtEnd={false} />.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a quick demo:
            <br /> 1. sign up <Anch link="https://bnbnotifier.com" text="here" addSpaceAtEnd={false} />
            <br /> 2. go to official <Anch link="https://airbnb.com" text="Airbnb Website" addSpaceAtEnd={false} /> and search for an area you want to
            stay in with all your specific parameters like price, dates, amenities etc.
            <br /> 3. copy that url
            <br /> 4. in the dashboard of BnbNotifier, add a new url
            <br /> 5. done
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an MVP, the code would need an entire face list/system redesign once there are a few users. The app scraps one Airbnb url hour. So
            at most it can scrap 24 in a day. This is because I lacked knowledge of how periodic web scraping in a production environment really works
            but now I have a better understanding and appreciation which I am proud to have learnt from just creating this app.
            <br /> For a revamp, I would probably have to dive into renting a VPS, Virtual Private Server, which are about $5/mo. This would eliminate
            AWS and Vercel. <br /> I also learnt more about what it means to validate an idea. I wrote a a bit about validating this idea in{" "}
            <Anch link="/blog/1" text="this blog" addSpaceAtEnd={true} /> thought what I never touched on was how feasible the software
            solution/system design was. I feel I could have never really known, maybe in hindsight, I could have researched webscraping in an
            production environment. I am pretty stoked on the system design for the app though, here it is below:{" "}

          <p>
            This is a little complicated to just setup a cron-like job but in Vercel, the place where I host the app, the free tier only allows 1 cron
            job with a period of 24 hours. Meaning I would only be able to scrap an airbnb url ONCE a day, which is clearly not enough. Ideally I
            would like a system where I can scrap at least every hour x X users per day.
