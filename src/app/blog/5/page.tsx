            BnbNotifiter, an app I created to notify you of new Airbnb listings, is live. <br />
            You can view it <Anch link="https://bnbnotifier.com" text="here" addSpaceAtEnd={false} />.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a quick demo:
            <br /> 1. sign up <Anch link="https://bnbnotifier.com" text="here" addSpaceAtEnd={false} />
            <br /> 2. go to official <Anch link="https://airbnb.com" text="Airbnb Website" addSpaceAtEnd={false} /> and search for an area you want to
            stay in with all your specific parameters like price, dates, amenities etc.
            <br /> 3. copy that url
            <br /> 4. in the dashboard of BnbNotifier, add a new url
            <br /> 5. done
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an MVP, and the code will require a full system redesign once there are more users. The app currently scrapes one Airbnb URL per
            hour, allowing a maximum of 24 URLs per day. This limitation came from my initial lack of experience with periodic web scraping in a
            production environment. However, I have gained valuable insights through the development process.
            <br />
            <br /> For a future revamp, I may need to explore renting a Virtual Private Server &#40;VPS&#41;, which costs around $5/mo and would
            eliminate the need for AWS and Vercel. The free tier for Vercel limits me to one cron job execution per day. Ideally, I&apos;d like a
            system that allows scraping at least every hour for multiple users. Despite the limitations, I&apos;m happy with the system design so far.{" "}

            I&apos;ve also learned more about what it means to validate an idea. I wrote a bit about validating this concept in my blog, but I
            didn&apos;t fully address the feasibility of the software solution or system design. In hindsight, researching web scraping in a
            production environment would have been beneficial.
