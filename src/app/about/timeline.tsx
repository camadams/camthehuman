We were close to many beaches and remembered having great times at the beach with my mom in the summer, swimming and eating ice cream.\n\nI remember being fascinated by numbers and gadgets. The excitement of counting to 100 for the first  and running to tell my mom, or asking my dad what "a billion times a billion" is.',

By the end of high school, double Maths days were my favorite.\n\nDownhill skating was a big passion. Spending every day after school skating and socializing with other skaters on the hill led to strong friendships that have lasted into adulthood. It was common to name your skate crew after the suburb where you skated most. Ours was CFR (Capri FreeRiders), and eventually, most of the crew proudly got CFR tattoos",

I attended a talk promoting the first-year Computer Science course, and it intrigued me, so I signed up.\n\n Solving my first homework assignment - writing a simple algorithm to calculate the perimeter of a house which involved understanding variables and user input, was so satisfying and got me hooked. I even showed it to my mom and tried to explain it to her!',

The bustling streets filled with scooters and the unique flow of traffic fascinated me, as did trying the local cuisine.",

This felt like a huge accomplishment and was proud to have completed it.\n\n To be honest, I was glad Pure Mathematics was over. Writing proofs was challenging and was far away from were I started my fascination for Maths. Computer Science, especially the programming side, maintained that early love for solving problems with Math and Logic. I take my hat off to those students that got A's through out Uni. The ones who did the best were the ones that saw the learning material before it arrived in lectures. Some students had both their parents with PhDs in Computer Science and engineering and were doing projects for post-graduates.\n\n Also, for me, University wasn’t the socially vibrant experience many associate it with, as I lived 30kms from campus so it was difficult to  participate in evening activities or societies.

So in the first half of the year, I ended up leading a band, playing gigs around the deep south, and recorded a four-track EP at a friend’s studio.\n\nIn the second half, I traveled. I visited Europe for the first time, staying with my uncle in the south of France, and returned to Vietnam. From there, I embarked on a solo backpacking trip to Kerala, India, which was a significant milestone for me. Planning and executing the trip alone gave me a sense of accomplishment.",

Living close to campus, I joined a couple of societies—Choir and the Japanese Club. This was the university experience I had longed for but had missed in my first three years.\n\nIn the middle of the year, during peak Covid lockdown, I met my first girlfriend through a dating app. Balancing my studies while having to learn new things about myself through the relationship was a lot, though I look back at traveling around South Africa with her and our friends fondly.",

It due to various causes and a significant catalyst that threw my ability to rationalize my thoughts and emotions. This forced me to seek support and strengthen my relationships with those closest to me, a transformative experience that continues to shape me.\n\n My biggest take away was: even if someone has a roof over there head, food to eat and \"seems\" to have everything together, they might be fighting battles they do not speak off. While this truth may seem obvious, it wasn't really until being in a short period of suffering in silence due to fear of rejection and stigma, that it really settled in me. A truly humbling experience.\n\n I still maintained my job and had something special to look forward to at the end of the year - a dear friend's wedding. Friends from all over came together, dropping everything to be there. I was a groomsman and was a much needed reunion with my closest friends.",

I asked myself, what would be a fun and meaningful way to spend the free time that comes with having a remote job? Surfing came to mind. Some early morning sessions in the late summer were really amazing and unforgettable.\n\n I lived in a shared Airbnb, that offered a taste of student life as many international students did volunteer work nearby.\n\nBy the end of the year, I had worked at my first company for nearly three years. Feeling the need to explore new opportunities, I began interviewing for other roles and noted that a lot companies looked for a CV with fully fledged apps. I stumbled upon a product starter kit from YouTuber Theo T3, and I was amazed how efficient he made it to get a product from 0 to production with an amazing developer experience. I also found a community of independent developers and creators on X/Twitter who independently built their own products.\n\nI developed some momentum and started building and prototyping apps in Next.js- a very popular full stack framework. It was a fun and rewarding experience to build something that could help people.",

It was quieter and slower than Muizenberg. \n\n I resigned from my job after three years and am taking an extended break. Initially I wanted to go straight into traveling, but ended up enjoying taking it slow and enjoyed continuing to make my own apps. I launched my first consumer-ready software product, bnbnotifier.com, complete with user accounts, a software service, and payment integration. The app notifies you when a new Airbnb listing is available an area searched for.\n\n The app after that - an efficient spending tracker app - I created a pamphlet and survey to gather user feedback, a rewarding exercise that tested my sales and people skills.",

I’ve developed a love for long-distance hiking, which to some people might sound like a drag - lugging a heavy pack, eating simple meals, being sweaty and dirty - but for me, the simple rewards far outweigh the challenges. The sights, the fitness, and the joy of stepping away from overstimulating, anxiety-inducing internet scrolling have made it an unforgettable experience.",
