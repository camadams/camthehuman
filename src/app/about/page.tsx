                  I grew up with my mom, dad, and brother in the same house in a small, quiet suburb in the deep south of Cape Town, South Africa. We
                  were close to many beaches and remembered having great times at the beach with my mom in the summer, swimming and eating ice cream.

                  Around Grade 9, I developed a keen interest in Maths. I loved drawing graphs and understanding fractions. By the end of high school,
                  double Maths days were my favorite - "such a nerd", I know right?
                  <br />
                  <br />I spent mosts afternoons after school skating and socializing with other skaters on the hill, which led to strong friendships
                  that have lasted into my adulthood.

                  I continued feeding my curiosity for Maths and Physics at the University of Cape Town. I needed to fill a fourth course, and I
                  remember my dad saying that "computers are the way forward." I attended a talk promoting the first-year Computer Science course, and
                  it intrigued me, so I signed up! Little did I know that this course would spark an interest of deep and fulfilling.
                  <br />
                  <br /> Solving my first homework assignment - writing a simple algorithm to calculate the perimeter of a house which involved
                  understanding the basics such as variables and user input, was so satisfying and got me hooked. I even showed it to my mom and tried
                  to explain it to her!

                  <br />

                  After three years and shuffling around my majors, I completed a science degree in Maths and Computer Science. This felt like a huge
                  accomplishment and was proud to have completed it.
                  <br />
                  <br /> To be honest, I was glad Pure Mathematics was over. Writing proofs was challenging and was far away from were I started my
                  fascination for Maths. Computer Science, especially the programming side, maintained that early love for solving problems with Math
                  and Logic. I take my hat off to those students that got A's through out Uni. The ones who did the best were the ones that saw the
                  learning material before it arrived in lectures. Some students had both their parents with PhDs in Computer Science and engineering
                  and were doing projects for post-graduates.
                  <br />
                  <br /> Also, for me, University wasnâ€™t the socially vibrant experience many associate it with, as I lived 30kms from campus so it
                  was difficult to participate in evening activities or societies.

                  Coming out of university, I wasnâ€™t sure what to do next. I had not taken a gap year so I was keen on a break from studying. So in
                  the first half of the year, I ended up leading a band, playing gigs around the deep south, and recorded a four-track EP at a
                  friendâ€™s studio.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In the second half, I traveled. I visited Europe for the first time, staying with my uncle in the south of France, and returned to
                  Vietnam. From there, I set out on a solo backpacking trip to Kerala, India, which was a significant milestone for me. Planning and
                  executing the trip alone gave me a sense of accomplishment.

                  This year marked a big milestone: my first full-time job. Earning a monthly salary gave me a sense of accomplishment and felt like a
                  rite of passage into adulthood. It was remote so I could move around a lot. I tried doing long term Airbnbs since they were at a
                  discount from the lack of people booking from the pandemic. I loved being able to explore different parts of Cape Town and meet new
                  people.

                  This was the most challenging year of my life so far. I experienced burnout early in the year. I find it difficult summarizing the
                  experience, but there were various causes and a significant catalyst that threw me, it threw my ability to rationalize my thoughts
                  and emotions. This forced me to seek support and strengthen my relationships with those closest to me, a transformative experience
                  that continues to shape and humble me.
                  <br />
                  <br /> My biggest take away was: even if someone has a roof over there head, food to eat and \"seems\" to have everything together,
                  they might be fighting battles they do not speak off. While this truth may seem obvious, it wasn't really until being in a short
                  period of suffering in silence due to fear of rejection and stigma, that it really settled in me.
                  <br />
                  <br /> I still maintained my job and had something special to look forward to at the end of the year - a dear friend's wedding.
                  Friends from all over came together, dropping everything to be there. I was a groomsman and was a much needed reunion with my
                  closest friends.

                  Continuing my Airbnb adventures, I moved to Muizenberg, a coastal, hippy-ish, surfing town about 10kms from my family home. I asked
                  myself, what would be a fun and meaningful way to spend the free time that comes with having a remote job? Surfing came to mind.
                  Some early morning sessions in the late summer were really amazing and unforgettable.
                  <br />
                  <br /> I lived in a shared Airbnb, that offered a taste of student life as many international students did volunteer work nearby.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  By the end of the year, I had worked at my first company for nearly three years. Feeling the need to explore new opportunities, I
                  began interviewing for other roles and noted that a lot companies looked for a CV with fully fledged apps. I stumbled upon a product
                  starter kit from YouTuber Theo T3, and I was amazed how efficient he made it to get a product from 0 to production with an amazing
                  developer experience. I also found a community of independent developers and creators on X/Twitter who independently built their own
                  products.
                  <br />
                  <br />I developed some momentum and started building and prototyping apps in Next.js- a very popular full stack framework. It was a
                  fun and rewarding experience to build something that could help people.

                  I started the year living in Kommetjie, another coastal suburb near my family home. It was quieter and slower than Muizenberg.{" "}
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I resigned from my job after three years and am taking an extended break. Initially I wanted to go straight into traveling, but
                  ended up enjoying taking it slow and continuing to make my own apps. I launched my first consumer-ready software product,
                  bnbnotifier.com, complete with user accounts, a software service, and payment integration. The app notifies you when a new Airbnb
                  listing is available an area searched for.
                  <br />
                  <br /> The app after that - an efficient spending tracker app - I created a pamphlet and survey to gather user feedback, a rewarding
                  exercise that tested my sales and people skills.

                  In November, I joined my now girlfriend and three other new friends to hike the Lycian Way, a 300km trail along Turkeyâ€™s southern
                  coast, passing 25 ancient ruins, that takes about 25-30 days. Iâ€™ve developed a love for long-distance hiking, which to some people
                  might sound like a drag - lugging a heavy pack, eating simple meals, being sweaty and dirty - but for me, the simple rewards far
                  outweigh the challenges. The sights, the fitness, and the joy of stepping away from overstimulating, anxiety-inducing internet
                  scrolling have made it an unforgettable experience.

                  double Maths days were my favorite. Downhill skating was a big passion. Spending every day after school skating and socializing with
                  other skaters on the hill led to strong friendships that have lasted into adulthood. It was common to name your skate crew after the
                  suburb where you skated most. Ours was CFR (Capri FreeRiders), and eventually, most of the crew proudly got CFR tattoos.
