          {`About Me
          Pre-2010
          I grew up with my mom, dad, and brother in the same house in a small, quiet suburb in the deep south of Cape Town, South Africa. We never moved, and my childhood was filled with simple joys. Living close to many beaches, I have fond memories of summers spent swimming and eating ice cream with my mom.
          
          2010–2015
          I’ve always been fascinated by numbers and gadgets. I vividly remember the excitement of counting to 100 for the first time and running to tell my mom, or asking my dad what "a billion times a billion" is. Around Grade 9, I developed a deep interest in math. I loved drawing linear equations and understanding fractions. By the end of high school, double math days were my favorite.
          
          2016
          At the University of Cape Town, I continued feeding my curiosity for math and physics. I needed to fill a fourth course, and I remember my dad saying that "computers are the way forward." I attended a talk promoting the first-year computer science course, and it intrigued me, so I signed up. Completing my first homework assignment - writing a simple algorithm to calculate the perimeter of a house - was exhilarating. It involved understanding variables and user input, and solving it got me hooked. I even showed it to my mom and tried to explain it to her!
          
          2017
          In my second year, computer science and math was still my passions, and I enjoyed learning every day. I especially remember being excited about learning Java objects and preparing for lectures by doing my own research. This was also the year I traveled outside South Africa for the first time, visiting my brother in Vietnam. The bustling streets filled with scooters and the unique flow of traffic fascinated me, as did trying the local cuisine.
          
          2018
          After three years and shuffling around my majors, I completed a science degree in Math and Computer Science. University wasn’t the socially vibrant experience many associate it with, as I lived 30 kilometers from campus and didn’t participate in evening activities or societies.
          
          2019
          Coming out of university, I wasn’t sure what to do next. Although there were internship programs, they weren’t well-advertised, so I found out pretty late, so I kind of slipped into a gap year. In the first half of the year, I pursued music, leading a band, playing gigs around the deep south, and recording a four-track EP at a friend’s studio.
          
          In the second half, I traveled. I visited Europe for the first time, staying with my uncle in the south of France, and returned to Vietnam. From there, I embarked on a solo backpacking trip to Kerala, India, which was a significant milestone for me. Planning and executing the trip alone gave me a sense of accomplishment.
          
          2020
        After a year of playing music and traveling, I felt fulfilled, having accomplished something unique and grown personally. I was ready to return to studying Computer Science. Living close to campus, I joined a couple of societies—Choir and the Japanese Club. This was the university experience I had longed for but had missed in my first three years.
          In the middle of the year, during peak Covid lockdown, I met my first girlfriend through a dating app. Balancing my studies while having to learn new things about myself through the relationship was a lot thought I look back at traveling around South Africa with her and our friends fondly.
          
          2021
          This year marked a big milestone: my first full-time job. Earning a monthly salary gave me a sense of accomplishment and felt like a rite of passage into adulthood. It was remote so I could move around a lot. I tried doing long term Airbnbs since they were at a discount from the lack of people booking from the pandemic. I loved being able to explore different parts of Cape Town and meet new people.
          
          2022
          This was the most challenging year of my life so far. I experienced burnout early in the year due to various causes and a significant catalyst that disrupted my ability to rationalize my thoughts and emotions. This forced me to seek support and strengthen my relationships with those closest to me, a transformative experience that continues to shape me.
          
          2023
          I moved to Muizenberg, a coastal, hippy-ish, surfing town about 10kms from my family home. I wanted to spend more time outdoors and thought surfing was a great way to do so. Some early morning sessions in the late summer were really amazing and unforgettable. 
          
          I lived in a shared Airbnb, which offered a taste of student life as many international volunteers stayed nearby.
          
          By the end of the year, I had worked at my first company for nearly three years. Feeling the need to explore new opportunities, I began interviewing for other roles and building my own software tools. Inspired by YouTuber Theo T3’s efficient product starter kit/boiler kit, i was amazed how efficient he made it to get a product from 0 to production with an amazing developer experience. 
          
          2024
          I started the year living in Kommetjie, another coastal suburb near my family home. It’s quieter than Muizenberg but slower and more peaceful. I resigned from my job after three years and am taking an extended break. Initially I wanted to go straight into traveling, but ended up enjoying taking it slow and enjoyed continuing to make my own apps

          I launched my first consumer-ready software product, bnbnotifier.com, complete with user accounts, a software service, and payment integration. The app after that - an efficient spending tracker app - I created a pamphlet and survey to gather user feedback, a rewarding exercise that tested my sales and people skills.
          
          In November, I joined my now girlfriend and three other new friends to hike the Lycian Way, a 300km trail along Turkey’s southern coast, passing 25 ancient ruins, that takes about 25-30 days. I’ve developed a love for long-distance hiking, which to some people might sound like a drag - lugging a heavy pack, eating simple meals, and somethings have below average showers - but for me, the simple rewards far outweigh the challenges. The sights, the fitness, and the joy of stepping away from overstimulating, anxiety-inducing internet scrolling have made it an unforgettable experience.
